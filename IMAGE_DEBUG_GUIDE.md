# Chat Image Troubleshooting Guide

## What I Fixed

1. **Fixed Next.js Image Configuration**
   - Corrected typo: `imgages.clerk.dev` → `images.clerk.dev`
   - Added additional Clerk domains: `images.clerk.com`, `img.clerk.com`
   - Added common OAuth provider domains: Google, GitHub, Gravatar

2. **Improved Chat Avatar Component**
   - Added error state tracking for failed images
   - Better fallback to initials when images fail to load
   - Added debugging logs to console
   - Improved error handling with `onError` and `onLoad` events

3. **Enhanced UI Robustness**
   - Added proper object-fit for images (`object-cover`)
   - Better responsive handling for chat containers
   - Improved text wrapping and overflow handling

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check User Image URL
1. Start a meeting and open the chat
2. Look at the top-left corner for a debug panel showing:
   - User ID
   - User Name
   - Image URL
   - Whether an image is available

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Send a chat message
4. Look for these logs:
   - "User info for chat:" - shows what data is being sent
   - "✅ Image loaded successfully" or "❌ Image failed to load"

### Step 3: Test Image Loading
The debug panel shows two image tests:
- Next.js Image component (what the chat uses)
- Regular HTML img tag (for comparison)

### Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: No Image URL**
- Check if you're logged in with a provider that has profile images (Google, GitHub)
- Or upload a profile image in Clerk dashboard

**Issue 2: Image URL Blocked by Next.js**
- Check if the image domain is in `next.config.ts`
- Look for console errors about unauthorized domains

**Issue 3: Network/CORS Issues**
- Check Network tab in DevTools for failed requests
- Look for 403/404 errors on image URLs

**Issue 4: Clerk Configuration**
- Ensure your Clerk app allows profile images
- Check Clerk dashboard settings

## Quick Test

1. Join a meeting
2. Open chat (click chat button in controls)
3. Send a message: "Testing image"
4. Check if your avatar appears next to the message
5. Look at debug panel and console for clues

## Remove Debug Component

Once you've identified the issue, remove the debug component:

1. Remove `import UserImageDebug from "./UserImageDebug";` from `MeetingRoom.tsx`
2. Remove `<UserImageDebug />` from the JSX
3. Delete `components/UserImageDebug.tsx`

## Expected Results

After fixes:
- ✅ User images should load in chat messages
- ✅ Fallback initials if no image or image fails
- ✅ Proper error handling and debugging info
- ✅ Better responsive chat UI

## Next.js Domains Added

```typescript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'img.clerk.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'images.clerk.dev' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'images.clerk.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'www.gravatar.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'lh3.googleusercontent.com' },
    { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'avatars.githubusercontent.com' }
  ]
}
```

Let me know what you see in the debug panel and console!
