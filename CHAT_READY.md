## 🚀 Server Status

**✅ Development Server Running**
- **URL:** http://localhost:3001
- **Status:** Ready
- **Network:** http://192.168.56.1:3001

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Real Participant Messaging
**Problem:** Messages were simulated/AI-generated, not sent between real participants
**Solution:** Implemented Stream Video SDK's custom events for broadcasting messages

**How it works now:**
- Messages are broadcast to ALL participants in the meeting
- Each participant receives messages in real-time
- No automatic/simulated messages
- Only messages from actual participants appear

### 2. ✅ Profile Photo Display
**Problem:** User profile images not showing in chat
**Solution:** 
- Fixed Next.js configuration (corrected typo: `imgages` → `images`)
- Added multiple image hosting domains (Clerk, Google, GitHub, Gravatar)
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback to initials
- Using standard `<img>` tags instead of Next.js Image component

### 3. ✅ Message Broadcasting System
- Uses Stream's `call.sendCustomEvent()` to send messages
- Uses `call.on('custom')` to receive messages from others
- Prevents duplicate messages
- Messages persist during the meeting session

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Open Two Browsers
1. **Browser 1 (Chrome):** http://localhost:3001
2. **Browser 2 (Firefox or Chrome Incognito):** http://localhost:3001

### Step 2: Login to Both Browsers
- Login with different accounts (or use two different Clerk test accounts)
- Make sure you're logged in as different users

### Step 3: Create/Join Same Meeting
**Option A - Create New Meeting:**
1. Browser 1: Click "New Meeting" → Start meeting
2. Copy the meeting link/ID
3. Browser 2: Use the link to join the same meeting

**Option B - Use Personal Room:**
1. Browser 1: Go to "My Room" → Start meeting
2. Browser 2: Join using the same room link

### Step 4: Test Chat
1. **Browser 1:** Click the chat button (💬) at the bottom
2. **Browser 1:** Type "Hello from User 1" and press Enter
3. **Browser 2:** Open chat - you should see the message!
4. **Browser 2:** Reply "Hi from User 2"
5. **Browser 1:** Should see the reply appear

### Step 5: Check Profile Photos
- ✅ Your profile photo should appear next to your messages
- ✅ Other participant's photo should appear next to their messages
- ✅ If no photo, user initials should appear (colored circle)
- Open console (F12) to see image loading logs

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### Messages:
- ✅ Messages appear for BOTH users in real-time
- ✅ No delay in message delivery
- ✅ No automatic/AI messages
- ✅ Messages only from actual participants
- ✅ Timestamps show correctly
- ✅ "You" label for your own messages

### Profile Photos:
- ✅ Profile photos load and display correctly
- ✅ If image fails, colorful initials appear
- ✅ Different colors for different users
- ✅ Consistent avatar for each user

### UI/UX:
- ✅ Chat opens/closes smoothly
- ✅ Unread message counter works
- ✅ Auto-scroll to new messages
- ✅ Character limit (500 chars) enforced
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Messages not appearing for other user"
**Check:**
1. Both users are in the SAME meeting (check meeting ID)
2. Browser console for any errors (F12)
3. Both users have opened the chat window

**Solution:** Refresh both browsers and rejoin the meeting

### "Profile photos not showing"
**Check:**
1. Console logs (F12) - look for "Image loaded" or "Image failed"
2. User has a profile photo in Clerk dashboard
3. Fallback initials should still show

**If you see initials instead of photo:**
- This is normal! It means either:
  - User doesn't have a profile photo
  - Image failed to load (but chat still works)
  - Initials are the fallback (works great!)

### "Port 3000 is in use"
**This is normal!** Server automatically switched to port 3001.
Use: http://localhost:3001

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why do I see initials instead of photos?**
A: This is the fallback. If the profile photo fails to load or doesn't exist, colored initials appear. This is intentional and looks great!

**Q: Do messages persist after the meeting?**
A: No, messages only exist during the meeting session. They're cleared when users leave.

**Q: Can I send private messages?**
A: Not yet. All messages are sent to all participants. Private messaging would require additional implementation.

**Q: How many characters can I send?**
A: Maximum 500 characters per message. The counter shows remaining characters.

**Q: Can I send emojis?**
A: Yes! Type emojis directly using your keyboard or emoji picker.
